# Data Structures & Algorithms Final Project
## Recognising COVID Rapid Test Results

### Objective
* COVID rapid tests will continue to play a key role in the post-pandemic world 
* Our project aims to develop a digital self-validation program for COVID rapid tests
* This involves recognising handwritten serial numbers and test results

### Minimum Viable Product
1. Extract serial number from image
1. Extract test result from image
